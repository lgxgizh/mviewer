## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Plugin loading framework (`PluginLoader` + `PluginManager`) with lifecycle management
- UI fixture screenshot regression test (`ui_fixture`)
- AddressSanitizer CI job for memory-leak / UB detection
- Benchmark baseline comparison (`--baseline <csv> --threshold <ratio>`)
- Bicubic and Lanczos interpolation in `RenderEngine`
- Predictive preloading (`ImageRepository::prefetchVisible`)
- Parallel directory loading (`ImageRepository::loadDirectory`)
- Vision regression test framework (`vision_regression`)
- Golden image regression framework (`golden_main`)
- Per-scenario benchmark suite (`benchmark_scenario`)
- `clang-format` configuration and CI formatting check
- **M3 Phase-1 — Core Image Pipeline:**
- TIFF (`.tif`/`.tiff`) added as a first-class supported format across `Decoder`,
  `FileSystem`, and all UI file filters (decode path is codec-gated; see note below).
- `ImageRepository::load` now populates the in-memory Viewer/FullImage LRU cache, so
  switching to an adjacent image is instant after the first decode.
- `ImageViewer` now loads exclusively through `ImageRepository` (no decode logic in the
  QWidget); the histogram is reused from the `ImageFrame` cache, not re-decoded.
- Pixel Inspector: `ImageViewer` emits `pixelInfo(x,y,r,g,b,valid)` on mouse move, read
  directly from the `ImageFrame` pixels (not `QImage`). Wired to the main-window status bar.
- `m3pipeline_tests` acceptance suite covering repository→frame, 4-format decode,
  Viewer LRU cache hit, and pixel-inspector reads.

### Added (M3 Phase-2 — Pixel Inspector panel)
- `AnalysisPanel` gains a **Pixel Inspector** tab that live-displays the hovered pixel:
  coordinates, Left RGB, and (when a second image is loaded) Right RGB / per-channel
  Δ / euclidean distance. Fed by `ImageViewer::pixelInfo` (frame-derived RGB), so the
  primary read still comes from `ImageFrame`, never `QImage`.
- `m3pipeline_tests` now also covers the inspector delta math (zero-delta on identical
  pixels; correct per-channel Δ and euclidean distance).
- **M3 Phase-2 — Selection-driven analysis (registry path):** `AnalysisPanel` now holds
  the left image as an `ImageFrame` (`setFrame`) and routes ROI analysis through
  `AnalyzerRegistry::create("histogram")->analyzeRegion(frame, selection)`, consuming
  `mviewer::domain::Selection` (not `QRect`). The legacy `AnalysisEngine` path is kept
  only as a fallback when no `ImageFrame` is available. `ImageViewer::frame()` exposes the
  backing `ImageFrame` so the QWidget layer decodes nothing.

- **M4 — Analyzer registry is the single UI entry point:** `AnalysisPanel`'s analyzer
  dropdown is now populated from `AnalyzerRegistry::availableAnalyzers()` (histogram,
  noise, entropy, psnr, sharpness, ssim, rgbmean) instead of a hardcoded "histogram".
  Switching the active analyzer — and every ROI analysis — routes through
  `AnalyzerRegistry::create(id)->analyzeRegion(frame, selection)`. Each built-in analyzer
  exposes a generic `resultText()` so the panel renders any registered analyzer without
  custom code. `test_m3m4m5` now asserts all built-ins are creatable via the registry and
  produce a non-empty result.
- **M4 acceptance tests (AC2/AC3):** `testAnalyzerRegistryConsistency` proves the registry
  is the real single entry point — ROI analysis honors an arbitrary `Selection` (left vs
  right half differ) and its results agree with `AnalysisEngine::computeStatsROI` on the
  same region (rgbmean rMean and histogram lumMean within 1.0). This is the core M4 claim
  that `Analyze(selection)` replaces reading `QRect`.
- **M4 — Difference heatmap overlay (compare mode):** `CompareWorkspace` now builds a
  difference heatmap per cell (cell *i* vs base) from the core layer
  (`CompareEngine::differenceMap` → `DifferenceEngine::heatMap`) and hands it to
  `RawImageView::setOverlay` for compositing over the base image with the same
  transform (tracks zoom/pan). The QWidget layer performs no decoding — it only renders a
  QImage the workspace produced from core data. Restores the M4 deliverable that was
  previously dead code (an off-screen canvas that was never blitted). Guarded by
  `testCompareDiffOverlay` in `test_m3m4m5`.

### Added (M5 — Scale & Performance, partial)
- `testCacheManagerM5`: verifies the 5-level cache hierarchy — SQLite-backed disk tier
  persists decoded pixels across a memory clear (byte-identical round-trip, proving the
  disk cache is the durable store / survives restart), and `CacheManager::levelStats`
  reports per-level hit/miss counts with a computed hit ratio.
- `testPredictivePreload`: verifies `ImageRepository::prefetch` warms adjacent images
  from the disk tier into the in-memory FullImage LRU, so navigating to a neighbor is
  instant after cache warm-up (the deterministic core of `prefetchVisible`).

### Changed (M4)
- `TaskScheduler` now uses PIMPL to keep Qt threading primitives out of the core header
- `ImageObject` header no longer depends on `QDateTime`
- `CacheManager::diskUsageBytes()` now reports real disk usage via `DiskCache::totalBytes()`
- CI workflow uses portable `${{ github.workspace }}/Qt` paths (no hardcoded `D:\QT`)
- All test/golden paths resolved via `MVIEWER_SOURCE_DIR` (no hardcoded local paths)
- **M3 Phase-1:** `ImageViewer::loadPixmap` refactored to call `ImageRepository::load`
  (removed its private `Decoder`/`CacheManager` decode path and standalone QPixmap LRU).
- **TIFF codec note:** TIFF decode requires the Qt `qtiff` plugin plus an MSVC-built
  `libtiff-6.dll` deployed beside the executable (`imageformats/qtiff.dll`). The format
  pipeline lists TIFF and the `m3pipeline_tests` TIFF case auto-skips when the codec is
  absent, so the suite stays green and TIFF is exercised automatically once the codec ships.

### Removed
- Obsolete `src/analyze_main.cpp` and `src/visual_test.cpp` (hardcoded paths)
- `RenderCommand.h` / `RenderTypes.h` (consolidated into `RenderEngine.h`)
- **M3 cleanup:** dead `CompareWorkspace::paintEvent` off-screen `canvas` composite
  (base/diff/selection/histogram passes drawn into a `QPixmap` that was never blitted —
  `RawImageView` already paints itself). Also removed the now-unused `m_stats` member,
  `drawCellHistogram` declaration, and `RenderEngine`/`QPainter` includes from the compare
  layer. No behavior change; compare cells still receive the synchronized transform.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Initial architecture: 3-panel UI (DirectoryTree, ThumbnailPanel, AnalysisPanel)
- Compare Engine: multi-image sync zoom/pan, blink, difference maps
- Analysis Engine: histogram, PSNR, SSIM, noise, ROI statistics
- Image export: PNG/JPEG/BMP/WebP with quality control
- CacheManager: 5-level cache hierarchy (Metadata → Thumbnail → Preview → Viewer → Disk)
- TaskScheduler: 5 independent priority queues
- Analyzer plugin interface + 7 built-in analyzers
- Core test suite (compare, layout, sync, diff) and unit tests
